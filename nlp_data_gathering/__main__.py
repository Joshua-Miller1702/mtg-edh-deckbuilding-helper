#grab ~100 cards from the magic api

#Make card function buckets

#also make buckets for card types

#sort cards into the buckets manually

#make a csv file with the card names and the buckets of half the cards ~50% cards
#make a second file for validation with ~5% of cards
#Make a test file with 45% of cards to test the model

#implement some kind of nlp model (naieve bayesian) to autosort the cards into the buckets

#test using test file to see if the model is accurate

#hope to god that the model is pretty good the first time round :)
